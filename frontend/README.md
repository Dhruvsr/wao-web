# Hosting Instructions

This must be hosted after backend is done hosting because backend url is required here.

Set `API_URL` env variable to backend url. Example, if the url given to you by render is something like `https://backend.onrender.com`, then set `API_URL` to `https://backend.onrender.com`. Please make sure there is no trailing slash.
